# Ball to Bucket
This project is a gaming app which involves a bucket at the bottom of the screen and three balls at the top of the screen. The user must draw on the screen, creating lines, to make a path for the balls to get to the bucket. At the end of the round, the balls reset and the bucket moves to another location, but the lines remain, making each round harder than the last.
